As a Management Consultant in the field of Quality and Testing I have 3 work areas:
1) Advisory assignments: Manage and Supervise quality and testing projects (e.g. end-to-end testing), create or improve quality and test policies, organize quality and testing organization. 
I coach professionals to improve their reviewing and testing skills using various approaches (e.g. Exploratory Testing) and techniques. Assess the status of the organization (using the PointZERO vision or TPI NEXT), set a target for improvement and collaborate towards that goal.

2) I am a fellow of SogetiLabs (Research & Development): Investigate new trends in software testing and develop this towards new methods and approaches. Currently investigating the impact of Robotics on the Testing profession.
Previously authored the PointZERO vision and Quality Supervision (2012). Contributed to Testing in an IoT Environment (2016), TMap HD (2014), TMap NEXT in Scrum (2012), TPI NEXT (2009) and TMap NEXT BDTM (2008).
Author of the book TestGrip: About test policy and test organisation (2007).

3) Training: Create new courses and workshops on quality assurance and software testing, train classes of both novice and experienced testers. I am an accredited trainer for TMap, TPI and ISTQB certifications.
