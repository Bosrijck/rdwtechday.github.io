Henk and his merry band of extraordinary engineers are designing, creating and operating the next generations of ING's global engineering platform. Challenges that thrill them are: 
- how to focus the work of 700+ autonomous teams to deliver the most value for customers? 
- how to create a compliant banking platform from version control to production within 24 hrs?
- how to operate a self-repairing banking platform that is changed daily by thousands of engineers? 
- how to control IT Risk while being completely transparent and factual to knowledgeable auditors?
- how to re-skill people continuously in a world of fast changing technologies and so-called talent gaps?

ING's engineering platform bootstraps ING's banking platform. Our challenge is to deliver competitive advantage via a mix of cutting edge, in-house bred and mundane tools to 10.000 developers, ops engineers, designers, and product owners in 20 countries, 10 datacenters and 2 public cloud providers across the globe.
